# Terra Money
![banner](docs/terra-sdk-img.png)

**[The Terra Protocol](https://www.terra.money)** facilitates the creation of digital assets _Terra_ that track the value of major fiat currencies. 

**Key features:**

- A family of stable-coins pegged to major currencies, at genesis SDR, USD, KRW, JPY, EUR, and CNY. 
- Stability achieved by creating mining incentives that are countercyclical to Terra demand
- Delegated Proof-of-Stake (Tendermint) consensus formed over the mining token Luna 
- Zero-spread atomic swap amongst Terra currencies. 

The Terra Protocol builds on [Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) consensus and the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) toolkits. Please make sure to study these projects as well if you are not already familiar. 

**WARNING**: Terra is pre-launch software, and should not be used for real transactions. Breaking changes will come regularly.  

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.10+](https://golang.org/dl/)
