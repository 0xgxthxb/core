Terra is a new payment network that uses economic growth in its underlying currency to fund transaction discounts. It is able to do this by reallocating money supply growth to benefit retail consumers instead of to central banks. The value proposition to the end-user is simple: we offer you the same checkout / payment UX you've become accustomed to with KakaoPay and Stripe, but at a 5-8% discounts made possible by Terra's blockchain monetary policy. 

Ultimately, Terra aims to offer a stability token platform for dApp developers, called STability-as-a-Service (STaaS) that will allow for the creation of multiple classes of price-stable cryptocurrencies. 

**WARNING**: Terra is pre-alpha software, and should not be used for real transactions. Breaking changes will come regularly.  

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.10+](https://golang.org/dl/)
